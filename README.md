# Bucharest-presentation
A short Bucharest presentation website based on the New York presentation I have learned on the Codecademy platform

Implementation:
  
  -This is built using only html for the structure and css for styling.

Steps involved:
  
  -created the index.html file
  
  -created the style.css file

Future steps:
  
  -try to arrange to fit sections better (ex: the video section)
